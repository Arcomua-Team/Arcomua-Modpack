**Arcomua Modpack**, a powerful modpack specially designed to give you a better Minecraft experience with lots of optimization and useful modifications.

### Install

We use [MCBBS Modpack Format](https://www.mcbbs.net/thread-1247765-1-1.html) to pack our work. You can import Arcomua Modpack in HMCL/PCL2/BakaXL.

Just download the .zip file and install it as a modpack in your game launcher.

We made some video tutorial for [HMCL](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av438701520) or [PCL2/BakaXL](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av908952920) users. You can find them on bilibili.

Currently we do not support MultiMC or any fork of MultiMC(like PrismLauncher), you can use ATLauncher instead.

### Usage

You can launch it as a game version.
